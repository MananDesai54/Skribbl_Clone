## This website works similar to the way skribbl.io does <br>
#### Many users can get into a room and play the game together. In a single chance, a user is given a word, he/she has to draw the word to help others guess the word. Only one user can draw at a time. The other users have to guess the word within the given time limit using the chatbox provided on the right side. The earlier you guess the word, the more points you get. Once every player has drawn twice, a popup box shows the results of the game. You can directly go the landing page using the exit button provided in the popup box.

#### Salient features are : <br>

#### \*user-defined rooms functionality <br>

#### \* Chat functionality within it <br>

#### \* Color changing functionality

# Working

## Room Creation and joining
### To start the game, the host has to get to the landing page and enter his or her name and the name of the room he wants to create. Once he presses the join button, a room is created and other can join the game using the room name.

## Gameplay
### The host will get the chance to draw first. When everybody joins the room, the host can press the "OK" button in the popup button to start the timer. Once the timer is at 0, the chance to draw moves to the next user who joined and a new word is given to him. This cycle continues untill everyone gets a chance to draw two times. Others will have to guess the word using the hints given through the chat box. The chat box can be used for sending general textx mesaages also.
